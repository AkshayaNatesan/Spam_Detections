**SMS Spam Detection using LSTM (PyTorch)**

*Overview*

This project implements a deep learning based SMS spam classifier using PyTorch.
The goal was to build a sequence model capable of identifying spam messages while handling dataset class imbalance.
The model uses an embedding layer followed by a bidirectional LSTM and a linear classifier trained with weighted binary cross-entropy.
